"HIV1_MA_Hyb_0_1_0":{"file":"HIV1_MA_Hyb_0_1_1.json","description":"MA - Matrix protein forms a coat on the inner surface of the viral membrane. It plays a central role when new viruses bud from the surface of infected cells. This protein assembles into trimers, which then associate side-by-side on the membrane."},
"HIV1_ENV_4nco_0_1_1":{"file":"HIV1_ENV_4nco_0_1_4.json","description":"ENV - Envelope proteins gp120 and gp41 bind to receptors on the surface of cells that HIV infects, and then penetrate the surface to infect it with the viral RNA. The spikes formed by these proteins are highly decorated with carbohydrates, making them difficult to recognize by antibodies. The structures shown here include the portion outside the virus, and have all of the carbohydrates removed."},
"HIV1_NEF_Hyb_0_2_0":{"file":"HIV1_NEF_Hyb_0_2_1.json","description":"Nef - (negative regulatory factor) forces the infected cell to stop making several proteins that are important in cell defense. Nef is important in the progression of HIV infection to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)."},
